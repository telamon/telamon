# Hello
`2024-02-04`

I am dissapointed.  
Because of a general malfunction, I'm locked out of git-hub.  

> It kinda sucks cause I've been here like forever.

Dear Github office dwellers who
I hope are compassionate primates in nature.

I'm not a kid who's into buying toys nor fairytails,  
I'm just a hacker who loves research and publishes source code, for free.

If you force me to increment factors, then I have the right to choose which.  
This is my "second" factor:  

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIHSEdr0OkpoTLRoafuwpNGgynhDnY/UGH+5+osiEoWPK
```

Please add `ssh`-2fa support:

```bash
ssh git@github.com generate-trusted-websession

=> Welcome Back! https://github.com/ssh2fa-login?nonce=XXXX
```

Thanks.
