# Traces of Xorcery
`2024-01-06`

Just in case I get locked out in this corporate most ridiculous [mishandling of humanity's largest collection of open source code](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/78193).  
I'm leaving this note as a way to communicate where I've offed to.

- I won't be able to create new repositories
- I won't be able to participate in issues
- Guessing it's a matter of time before discussions get login-walled for read-access.
- Your SSH-keys are valid for now, so you can still push commits without 2FA.

At the moment I don't know where to go.
There is [git-pit](https://github.com/decentlabs-north/git-pit) as an decentralized alternative
to git-repos; and then there is an [Embryo for Issues](https://pico-todo.surge.sh/) also sporting
_full node on page load_.

But the `PiC0` project is still in-between versions so I'll just continue doing what ever it is that I do.

Keep searching for a _network without a super node_.
